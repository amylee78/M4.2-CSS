## Birdwatching

A mock birdwatching website to test and experiment with css such as flexbox, grid and more. 
There should be no interaction other then it looking pretty and a certian way.



## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.

It is also recomented to show this in browser to play with sizing and to see it in full screen vs 
small screen. the images hould stay in a 2x2 grid and the text should shrink to fit the boxes. The text should remain within the box its surrounded in. the text should stay within the box/grid it is in
